CONCEPT:

User profile page showing their chosen mountains

Click each mountain

Oh on the user profile page we’ll have simple stuff like weather, number of trails with hazards, etc

And then you can navigate to a mountains specific page

here, you get more detailed weather info, and then a list of trails

List of trails has name, section of the mountain (if applicable), and “conditions/hazards”

And there will be options to add other trails

And both the regular user and ski patrol will be able to post potential hazards, regular user will be able to “upvote them” whereas ski patrol will be able to “endorse” and mark other things like fixed or something

We also could have a more detailed trail view where users could post pics / small reports but that’s not completely necessary



The only objects we're storing are "trail" objects
trails=[]
trail: {
    mountain: "la montana"
    
}
